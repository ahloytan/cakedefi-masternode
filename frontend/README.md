# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Notes

1. Loading screen is presented while waiting for data to load and child component to be fully rendered
2. Visualisation using react-chartjs-2, components using material-ui
3. Can switch the "Total Assets Under Management" value to the following currencies: SGD, BTC, USD, EUR
4. USD value of DASH & DeFiChain values calculated using the sum of rewards (converted into USD)
5. Bulk of codes in "src/components/masternodes.js", styles in "App.css" 
6. Helper + API call (axios) functions are in "src/components/functions.js" (2 API calls were used - 1 from CakeDeFi, 1 from CoinGecko)
