# CakeDeFi-Masternodes
A simple full-stack web application to show the masternodes from DefiChain and Ethereum. Originally created for a takehome assignment, it has been adjusted to be a canvas for me to practice my React and Node.js in preparation for a hackathon

## Frontend
Tech stack: [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) <br>
Other libraries: Axios, ChartJS

## Backend
Tech stack: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com) <br>
